# Mobility-pattern
Discovering frequently visited trajectories of mobile users in mobility patterns based on reality dataset
This project discovered frequently visited trajectories of mobile users in mobility patterns
based on reality dataset. It used Geolife dataset as the source of mobile usersâ€™ trajectory
data and implement Stay Point Detection method to preprocess initial data. It implemented three
algorithms, Prefixspan algorithm, Matching_Based algorithm and Apriori algorithm, to discover
mobility patterns by Matlab programming. It collected results of each algorithm and show them by Excel and dynamic map in Baidu map by 
Java and HTML.
